## Modified-facenet

This implementation transmits webcam footage to the network to determine if the frame contains a person we recognize.

## How to use

To set all the requirements for the project, run:

	pip install -r requirements.txt

In the root directory. After installing the modules, you can run the project using Python:

	python facenet.py

## NOTE

This modification was used and works correctly with Windows 10 OS. If you want to run it on a different operating system, you will have to replace the configuration used in facenet.py
